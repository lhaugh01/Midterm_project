                    The MBTA Green Line consists of multiple branches—B, C, D, and E—serving key destinations across the Boston area.
                    It connects bustling hubs like Government Center and Park Street with neighborhoods such as Allston, Brookline, 
                    Newton, and Somerville. Major stops include North Station, Copley, Kenmore, and Lechmere, providing access to 
                    landmarks like Fenway Park, Boston University, and the Museum of Fine Arts. The line blends underground and street-level
                    travel, offering a vital link across the city.
