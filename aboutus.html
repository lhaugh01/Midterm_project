                </h2>
                
                <p>
                    The Green Line of the Boston MBTA is committed to providing
                    safe, reliable, and efficient light rail service to 
                    residents, workers, and visitors across the Greater Boston
                    area. As the oldest subway line in America, we honor our
                    historic legacy while continuously improving accessibility,
                    sustainability, and passenger experience. Our mission is to
                    connect communities from downtown to the neighborhoods 
                    beyond, reducing congestion and environmental impact through
                    clean, electric transit. By prioritizing safety, innovation, 
                    and equity, we strive to keep Boston moving with a transit 
                    system that serves everyone.
